Dwarves is a browser based idle game, where players can build a team of dwarves to mine various minerals.
These minerals can be used to purchase upgrades for each dwarf, allowing for faster mining and thus more upgrading.
More upgrades and mines will unlock for the player as they progress throughout the game with a total of thirteen mines to unlock and twelve different upgrades to unlock.
There is also a leaderboard feature allowing players to test their dwarves against eachother.
